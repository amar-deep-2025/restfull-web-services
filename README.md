## 🔁 Resource Location Header

When creating a new resource (e.g., via POST), return the **URI of the new resource** using the `Location` header.

```java
URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()
    .path("/{id}")
    .buildAndExpand(savedUser.getId())
    .toUri();

return ResponseEntity.created(location).build();

Q:Location?
ANS: It tells the client where to find the newly created resource.

Q:>Location Header?
ANS: A uri pointing to the newly created resource

Add Exception when Resource Not Found

# Implementing Generic Exception Handling for all the Resource
1) Extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler-> For Handle all the Exception
2) create custom handleAllException method to handle
3) create handleUserNotFoundException method to handle NOT_FOUND Exception
